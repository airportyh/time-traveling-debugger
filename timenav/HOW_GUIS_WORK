            HOW GUIs WORK
            
            * The lower layer
                * graphics layer (Output)
                    * canvas / Qt QPainter
                        * drawLine
                        * drawRect
                        * drawEllipse
                        * drawImage
                        * drawText
                    * OpenGL
                    * terminal
                        * control codes
                    
                * user events (keyboard, mouse, others) (Input)
                    * HTML events
                    * Qt events
                    * OpenGL ?
                    * terminal - mouse events
                    * mouse (x, y coords)
                    * keyboard (key character / key code)
                    
            * UI Componentization
                * parent/child relationship
                * dynamic layout
                * composability of components
                * rule: a child must be contained by a parent in layout
